# Product Context - Created on March 8, 2023

## Why This Project Exists

This RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot demo project exists to showcase Synthalyst's expertise in building AI-powered chatbot solutions for various business use cases. The project aims to demonstrate how a single chatbot architecture can be adapted to multiple business scenarios, providing potential clients with a tangible example of what can be built for their specific needs.

## Problems It Solves

1. **Knowledge Access**: Makes organizational knowledge easily accessible through natural language queries
2. **Information Overload**: Helps users find relevant information from large document collections
3. **Specialized Assistance**: Provides domain-specific guidance (sales, onboarding, knowledge hub) based on uploaded documents
4. **Business Development**: Demonstrates Synthalyst's capabilities to potential clients
5. **User Education**: Shows how RAG technology can be applied to real-world business problems

## How It Should Work

1. **User Flow**:

   - Users land on a clean, Apple-inspired UI
   - They select a pre-built use case (e.g., "Sales Assistant")
   - On the use case page, they upload relevant files and chat in a single integrated view
   - A CTA encourages users to contact Synthalyst for custom solutions

2. **Technical Flow**:

   - User uploads documents in various formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT, CSV, etc.)
   - Documents are processed, chunked, and embedded into a vector database (Pinecone)
   - User queries are processed through a RAG pipeline that retrieves relevant context
   - AI generates responses based on the retrieved context and user query
   - Results are streamed back to the user in a chat interface

3. **Data Handling**:
   - Files are stored temporarily (24 hours for demo, 30 days for free tier)
   - Data is processed securely with appropriate encryption
   - Users can delete their data at any time

## User Experience Goals

1. **Simplicity**: Clean, intuitive interface inspired by Apple's design language
2. **Responsiveness**: Fast, smooth interactions with appropriate loading states
3. **Guidance**: Clear instructions on what files to upload for each use case
4. **Transparency**: Clear communication about how data is used and stored
5. **Delight**: Subtle animations and transitions to enhance the experience
6. **Accessibility**: Ensuring the application is usable by people with disabilities
7. **Mobile-Friendly**: Responsive design that works well on all devices

## Target Audience

1. **Business Decision Makers**: Looking for AI solutions to improve their operations
2. **Knowledge Workers**: Who need better tools to access information
3. **Sales Teams**: Seeking AI assistance for sales processes
4. **HR Departments**: Looking for better onboarding solutions
5. **IT Departments**: Evaluating AI tools for enterprise use

## Success Metrics

1. **Engagement**: Number of interactions with the chatbot
2. **Conversion**: Number of inquiries about custom solutions
3. **User Satisfaction**: Feedback on the usefulness of responses
4. **Technical Performance**: Response time, accuracy of information retrieval
5. **Business Impact**: Number of new clients acquired through the demo
