# Product Context [2025-02-03 16:00:00]

## Product Overview

The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system is designed to provide intelligent document processing and querying capabilities. It combines efficient text processing with cost-effective operations to deliver accurate and relevant responses.

## Core Problems Solved

1. **Document Processing**

   - Efficient text chunking with semantic boundaries
   - Support for multiple file types
   - Proper metadata handling
   - Error recovery and validation

2. **Cost Optimization**

   - Token usage optimization
   - Context pruning and prioritization
   - Efficient caching strategies
   - Resource usage monitoring

3. **User Experience**
   - Clear progress tracking
   - Informative error messages
   - Responsive interface
   - Intuitive file handling

## How It Works

### Document Processing Flow

1. User uploads document
2. System validates and processes file
3. Text is extracted and chunked semantically
4. Chunks are indexed with metadata
5. Document becomes available for querying

### Query Processing Flow

1. User submits query
2. System retrieves relevant context
3. Context is pruned and prioritized
4. Response is generated and streamed
5. Results are cached for efficiency
