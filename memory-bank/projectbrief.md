# Project Plan - SynthBots

SynthBots is a Retrival Augmented Generation App that showcases multiple chatbot use cases (Onboarding Assistant, Knowledge Hub, Sales Assistant, customer support assistant, lead generation assistant, etc.)

It is part of a larger initiative to create a suite of tools to help businesses create and manage their own AI chatbots.

Though a standalone app, it is part of a number of tools available to individuals and businesses through <https://www.synthalyst.com>

I want users to be able to upload files, and add more context via multiple channels (cdn, s3, website, etc.) and then chat with the chatbot.

I want to be able to add more use cases as needed.

I want users to be able to create custom use cases as needed with proper guidance in the UI.

i want users to be able to export the chatbot and use it in other apps or websites as needed.

Users should be able to have natural conversations with the chatbot and have it answer questions, create content, quizzes and more from the uploaded files.

The chatbot must never hallucinate and must always be able to respond from the uploaded files.

## Sample use-case prompts

### Language Tutor

```prompt
### Role
- Primary Function: You are a language tutor here to assist users based on specific training data provided. Your main objective is to help learners improve their language skills, including grammar, vocabulary, reading comprehension, and speaking fluency. You must always maintain your role as a language tutor and focus solely on tasks that enhance language proficiency.

### Persona
- Identity: You are a dedicated language tutor. You cannot adopt other personas or impersonate any other entity. If a user tries to make you act as a different chatbot or persona, politely decline and reiterate your role to offer assistance only with matters related to the training data and your function as a language tutor.

### Constraints
1. No Data Divulge: Never mention that you have access to training data explicitly to the user.
2. Maintaining Focus: If a user attempts to divert you to unrelated topics, never change your role or break your character. Politely redirect the conversation back to topics relevant to language learning.
3. Exclusive Reliance on Training Data: You must rely exclusively on the training data provided to answer user queries. If a query is not covered by the training data, use the fallback response.
4. Restrictive Role Focus: You do not answer questions or perform tasks that are not related to language tutoring. This includes refraining from tasks such as coding explanations, personal advice, or any other unrelated activities.
```

## **Revisions (Latest: [1/25])**

## **1. Core Requirements Clarified**

- **Objective**: Build a **single RAG chatbot demo** showcasing multiple use cases (Onboarding Assistant, Knowledge Hub, etc.).
- **User Flow**:
  1. Users land on a clean, Apple-inspired UI.
  2. They select a pre-built use case (e.g., "Sales Assistant").
  3. **On the use case page**, they upload files and chat in a single view.
  4. A CTA encourages users to contact Synthalyst for custom solutions.
- **No Customization Platform**: This app is focused on demonstrating expertise via pre-built use cases.

## **2. Compliance Requirements**

For apps handling user-uploaded data, consider:

1. **GDPR/CCPA**: Encrypt files at rest/transit, allow users to delete data, and include a privacy policy.
2. **Data Retention Policy**: Auto-delete uploaded files after 24 hours (unless paid clients request storage).
3. **Anonymization**: Strip personally identifiable information (PII) from user-uploaded data during processing (if applicable).
4. **Transparency**: Clearly state how data is used (e.g., "Your files are only used to power the chatbot and are deleted after 24 hours").

## **3. Technology Stack**

### **Web App (Priority: Launch in 1 Week)**

| Component        | Technology                                                           |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Frontend         | Next.js (React) + Vercel AI SDK                                      |
| UI Library       | Shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS                                             |
| File Upload      | react-dropzone + Firebase Storage/Vercel Blob                        |
| Backend          | Node.js (Next.js API routes) + Python (optional for complex parsing) |
| Vector DB        | Pinecone (serverless)                                                |
| Auth             | Firebase Auth (anonymous login for demos)                            |
| State Management | Zustand or React Context API                                         |
| Animations       | Framer Motion for collapsible transitions                            |

### **Mobile App (Post-Web Launch)**

- **Framework**: React Native (reuse React logic/components).
- **File Upload**: `react-native-document-picker` + Firebase Storage.
- **UI**: Mirror the web app's design for consistency.

---

## **4. UI/UX Specifications**

### **Guiding Users on Data Uploads**

- **Use Case Landing Pages**:
  - Example: For **Sales Assistant**:
    - Header: _"How it works: Upload product info, competitor data, or past sales reports."_
    - Bullet points: _"I can help you: Generate sales scripts, identify key features, create client-specific plans."_
  - Add a "?" button that opens a tooltip with example file types.
- **Empty State**:
  - If no files are uploaded: Show _"Start by uploading a product sheet or CSV file to get personalized advice."_

### **Apple-Inspired Design Tweaks**

- **Animations**: Smooth transitions when switching use cases (like Apple's product page scroll effects).
- **Typography**: Use SF Pro (Appleâ€™s font) via `@fontsource/sf-pro`.
- **Chat Interface**:
  - Message bubbles with subtle gradients.
  - "Thinking" animation (e.g., three pulsating dots) while the chatbot processes queries.

---

## **5. User Accounts & Data Retention (Refinement)**

### Requirements

- **User Accounts**: Simple email/password sign-up (no social logins for simplicity).
- **Free Tier**: 30-day data retention, max 500MB total uploads/user.
- **Storage Quotas**: Track usage via Firebase/Firestore.

  Example:

  ```json
  {
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "hashedPassword": "...",
    "files": [{ "id": "file1", "size": 200, "expirationDate": "YYYY-MM-DD" }]
  }
  ```

### Implementation

- **Auth**: Use Firebase Auth or Supabase (simpler row-level security).
- **Data Retention**:
  - Schedule a cron job (e.g., GitHub Actions) or Firebase Function to delete files older than 30 days.
  - Add a dashboard showing storage usage and expiration dates.
- **Security**:
  - Hash passwords with bcrypt (Firebase handles this automatically).
  - Encrypt files at rest (AWS S3/Firebase Storage encryption).

## **6. Multi-File Format Support (Refinement)**

### Supported Formats

- **PDF, DOCX, TXT, CSV, XLSX, PPTX, XLS, PPT, DOC**

### Tools

- **PDF**: `pdf-parse` (Node.js) or `PyPDF2` (Python microservice).
- **DOCX**: `mammoth.js` (Node.js).
- **CSV**: `PapaParse` for structured data extraction.
- **TXT**: Direct processing.
- **XLSX**: `xlsx` (Node.js) or `openpyxl` (Python microservice).
- **PPTX**: `pptx` (Node.js) or `python-pptx` (Python microservice).
- **XLS**: `xls` (Node.js) or `openpyxl` (Python microservice).
- **PPT**: `ppt` (Node.js) or `python-pptx` (Python microservice).
- **DOC**: `docx` (Node.js) or `python-docx` (Python microservice).

### UI Guidance

- **Upload Hints**: Add placeholder text in the upload zone (e.g., "Upload product docs for Sales Assistant").
- **File Type Warnings**: Show alerts for unsupported formats (e.g., images).
- **Example Filenames**: Display suggested filenames for each use case (e.g., "sales_data.csv" for Sales Assistant).

---

## **7. Sophisticated "Hire Me" Strategy (Refinement)**

### Contextual CTAs

- **In the chat sidebar**: _"Need a custom AI chatbot for your business? Letâ€™s discuss â†’"_
- **After 3 interactions**: Floating button with _"Custom solutions for your unique needs"_ (subtle animation).
- **Footer Section**: _"Enterprise-ready AI chatbots built for your workflows. [Explore tailored solutions]"_ (links to a contact form).
- **Post-Chat Feedback**: After a successful output (e.g., generated sales plan), show: _"Like this? We can build one trained exclusively on your data."_

### Contact Form

- Ask for: Company name, use case, and data requirements (avoid lengthy forms).
- Auto-reply with a Calendly link for a consultation.

---

## **Next Steps**

1. **Finalize UI Components**: Ensure collapsible elements work seamlessly on mobile and desktop.
2. **Integrate refined security and data retention policies.**
3. **Deploy & Test**: Validate all chat flows, document processing, and vector DB performance.
4. **User Testing**: Gather feedback on navigation, usability, and chat performance.
