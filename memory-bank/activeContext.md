# Active Context - Created on March 8, 2023

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on preparing the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot demo for deployment. The project is in the final stages of development, with the following areas being actively worked on:

1. **Deployment Configuration**: Setting up the necessary configuration for deploying to Vercel
2. **Database Migration**: Creating database schema for production deployment
3. **Security Enhancements**: Implementing CORS middleware and other security measures
4. **Environment Configuration**: Setting up proper environment variables for different environments
5. **Documentation**: Updating documentation for deployment and usage
6. **Error Handling**: Fixing runtime errors and improving error handling

## Recent Changes

### March 8, 2023 (Latest)

- Fixed metadata error: separated layout into server and client components to prevent "createMetadataComponents is not a function" error
- Fixed document list errors: handling undefined size and invalid date values
- Fixed deploymentId error: completely rewrote OpenAI stream and chat API route with robust error handling
- Fixed build errors related to import paths
- Created proper .env.example file with placeholder values
- Fixed failing tests in the chat API route
- Updated database configuration to support both development and production
- Created Vercel deployment configuration
- Added CORS middleware for API routes
- Created database migration script
- Updated README with deployment instructions
- Set up Memory Bank documentation structure

### Previous Changes (from docs/system/projectStatus.md)

- Implemented basic Next.js application structure
- Set up Tailwind CSS and Shadcn/ui components
- Created initial UI layouts for the application
- Integrated OpenAI API for chat functionality
- Set up Pinecone for vector database storage
- Implemented basic file upload functionality

## Next Steps

1. **Short-term (1-2 days)**:

   - Deploy to staging environment for testing
   - Run comprehensive tests in the staging environment
   - Fix any issues found during testing
   - Deploy to production

2. **Medium-term (3-7 days)**:

   - Implement monitoring and logging
   - Add analytics tracking
   - Optimize performance
   - Enhance error handling

3. **Long-term (8+ days)**:
   - Add more use case templates
   - Implement user authentication
   - Add more sophisticated document processing features
   - Develop mobile app version

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions

1. **Deployment Platform**:

   - Decided to use Vercel for deployment
   - Created vercel.json configuration file
   - Set up environment variables for Vercel

2. **Database Configuration**:

   - Updated database configuration to support both development and production
   - Created migration script for initializing the database schema
   - Added SSL support for production database connections

3. **Security Enhancements**:

   - Implemented CORS middleware for API routes
   - Added proper error handling for API routes
   - Ensured environment variables are properly secured

4. **Error Handling Approach**:
   - Implemented robust error handling for OpenAI and Pinecone initialization
   - Used type guards to handle different stream types in OpenAI stream utility
   - Simplified the chat API route to reduce complexity and potential error sources

### UX Considerations

1. **Error Handling**:

   - Improved error messages for API routes
   - Added proper error handling for chat responses
   - Enhanced error feedback for users

2. **Documentation**:
   - Updated README with deployment instructions
   - Added project structure documentation
   - Included environment setup instructions

### Open Questions

1. How to effectively monitor the application in production?
2. What metrics should we track to measure the effectiveness of the demo?
3. How to handle rate limiting and usage quotas for the OpenAI API in a production environment?
4. What is the optimal database configuration for production?
5. How to implement proper logging for debugging in production?
