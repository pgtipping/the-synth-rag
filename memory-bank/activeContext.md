### Technical Decisions

1. **Deployment Platform**:

   - Decided to use Vercel for deployment
   - Created vercel.json configuration file
   - Set up environment variables for Vercel

2. **Database Configuration**:

   - Updated database configuration to support both development and production
   - Created migration script for initializing the database schema
   - Added SSL support for production database connections

3. **Security Enhancements**:

   - Implemented CORS middleware for API routes
   - Added proper error handling for API routes
   - Ensured environment variables are properly secured

4. **Error Handling Approach**:

   - Implemented robust error handling for OpenAI and Pinecone initialization
   - Used type guards to handle different stream types in OpenAI stream utility
   - Simplified the chat API route to reduce complexity and potential error sources

5. **Routing Structure**:

   - Using dynamic routes with `/chat/[useCase]` for specific use cases
   - Added redirect from `/chat` to `/chat/onboarding` for better user experience
   - Maintained the existing structure where the home page links to specific use cases

6. **Vector Database Implementation**:

   - Decided to keep Pinecone as the vector database for production
   - Restored the full RAG implementation with Pinecone for better search results
   - Implemented robust error handling for Pinecone queries

7. **Enhancement Strategy**:

   - Following the plan in enhancement-plan.md
   - Implementing features in priority order
   - Maintaining focus on user value
   - Ensuring scalability of new features

8. **Client/Server Component Strategy**:
   - Components using React hooks are marked as client components
   - Page components remain server components where possible
   - UI components with interactivity are client components
   - Added proper documentation in .cursorrules

### UX Considerations

1. **Error Handling**:

   - Improved error messages for API routes
   - Added proper error handling for chat responses
   - Enhanced error feedback for users

2. **Documentation**:
   - Updated README with deployment instructions
   - Added project structure documentation
   - Included environment setup instructions

### Open Questions

1. How to effectively monitor the application in production?
2. What metrics should we track to measure the effectiveness of the demo?
3. How to handle rate limiting and usage quotas for the OpenAI API in a production environment?
4. What is the optimal database configuration for production?
5. How to implement proper logging for debugging in production?
