## Technical Decisions

1. **Type Safety Approach**:

   - Used TypeScript interfaces to define expected data structures
   - Implemented type guard functions to validate unknown data
   - Used filter methods to ensure only valid data is processed
   - Maintained strict type checking during build process
   - Avoided type assertions (as) in favor of proper validation

2. **Deployment Platform**:

   - Decided to use Vercel for deployment
   - Created vercel.json configuration file
   - Set up environment variables for Vercel

3. **Database Configuration**:

   - Updated database configuration to support both development and production
   - Created migration script for initializing the database schema
   - Added SSL support for production database connections

4. **Security Enhancements**:

   - Implemented CORS middleware for API routes
   - Added proper error handling for API routes
   - Ensured environment variables are properly secured

5. **Error Handling Approach**:

   - Implemented robust error handling for OpenAI and Pinecone initialization
   - Used type guards to handle different stream types in OpenAI stream utility
   - Simplified the chat API route to reduce complexity and potential error sources
   - Added proper error handling for database queries

6. **Routing Structure**:

   - Using dynamic routes with `/chat/[useCase]` for specific use cases
   - Added redirect from `/chat` to `/chat/onboarding` for better user experience
   - Maintained the existing structure where the home page links to specific use cases
   - Implemented dynamic rendering for pages with data fetching

7. **Vector Database Implementation**:

   - Decided to keep Pinecone as the vector database for production

8. **Enhancement Strategy**:

   - Following the plan in enhancement-plan.md
   - Implementing features in priority order
   - Maintaining focus on user value
   - Ensuring scalability of new features

9. **Client/Server Component Strategy**:

   - Components using React hooks are marked as client components
   - Page components remain server components where possible
   - UI components with interactivity are client components
   - Added proper documentation in .cursorrules

10. **Type Safety Strategy**:
    - Defined clear interfaces for all data structures
    - Used type guards to validate unknown data
    - Avoided type assertions in favor of proper validation

### Open Questions

1. How to effectively monitor the application in production?
2. What metrics should we track to measure the effectiveness of the demo?
3. How to handle rate limiting and usage quotas for the OpenAI API in a production environment?
4. What is the optimal database configuration for production?
5. How to implement proper logging for debugging in production?

## Current Focus: Progress Tracking System

### Recent Changes

- Moved progress tracking from user-facing UI to admin dashboard
- Progress tracking now serves as a debugging and monitoring tool
- Created admin-only routes and API endpoints for system monitoring
- Added system health metrics and database monitoring

### Key Decisions

1. Progress tracking will not be visible to regular users

   - Regular users already have Uppy for upload progress
   - Avoiding duplicate/confusing progress indicators
   - Simplified user experience

2. Admin Dashboard Features
   - System-wide progress monitoring
   - Database health metrics
   - Memory usage tracking
   - Session statistics
   - Error tracking and debugging tools

### Next Steps

1. Implement error states in admin dashboard

   - Authentication errors (401)
   - Rate limiting (429)
   - Server errors (500)
   - Network connectivity issues
   - Data fetch failures

2. Security considerations
   - Admin route protection
   - Rate limiting for API endpoints
   - Session-based authentication

### Active Considerations

- Need to ensure admin dashboard performance with high volume of sessions
- Consider data retention policies for progress tracking
- Plan for scaling metrics collection
