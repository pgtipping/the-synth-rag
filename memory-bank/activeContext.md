# Active Context - Created on March 8, 2023

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on implementing the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot demo with multiple use cases. The project is in the development phase, with the following areas being actively worked on:

1. **File Upload Component**: Implementing the file upload functionality with support for multiple file formats
2. **Chat Interface**: Building the chat interface with streaming responses
3. **Vector Database Integration**: Setting up Pinecone for document embeddings and retrieval
4. **Document Processing Pipeline**: Creating the pipeline for parsing, chunking, and embedding documents
5. **Use Case Selector**: Implementing the UI for selecting different use cases

## Recent Changes

### March 8, 2023

- Set up the Memory Bank documentation structure
- Created initial documentation files (projectbrief.md, productContext.md, systemPatterns.md, techContext.md)
- Reviewed project requirements and architecture

### Previous Changes (from docs/system/projectStatus.md)

- Implemented basic Next.js application structure
- Set up Tailwind CSS and Shadcn/ui components
- Created initial UI layouts for the application
- Integrated OpenAI API for chat functionality
- Set up Pinecone for vector database storage
- Implemented basic file upload functionality

## Next Steps

1. **Short-term (1-2 days)**:

   - Complete the file upload component with progress indicators
   - Implement the document processing pipeline
   - Connect the chat interface to the RAG backend
   - Add streaming response functionality

2. **Medium-term (3-7 days)**:

   - Implement multiple use case templates
   - Add authentication for demo users
   - Implement file management (listing, deletion)
   - Add error handling and fallback mechanisms
   - Implement the "Hire Me" CTAs and contact form

3. **Long-term (8+ days)**:
   - Add analytics for tracking user engagement
   - Implement A/B testing for different UI variations
   - Add more sophisticated document processing features
   - Optimize performance and reduce latency
   - Prepare for mobile app development

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions

1. **File Storage Solution**:

   - Currently evaluating Firebase Storage vs. Vercel Blob
   - Considerations: Cost, ease of integration, automatic expiration
   - Leaning towards Vercel Blob for simplicity and integration with Next.js

2. **Authentication Approach**:

   - Considering whether to implement full authentication or use anonymous sessions
   - Trade-off between user experience and security/tracking
   - Current plan: Start with anonymous sessions, add optional sign-up later

3. **Document Processing Strategy**:
   - Deciding between client-side vs. server-side processing
   - Considerations: Performance, security, user experience
   - Current approach: Initial client-side validation, then server-side processing

### UX Considerations

1. **File Upload Experience**:

   - How to provide clear guidance on what files to upload for each use case
   - How to handle large files and show progress
   - How to communicate processing status

2. **Chat Interface Design**:

   - How to display citations and references to source documents
   - How to handle streaming responses visually
   - How to provide feedback when the system is thinking/processing

3. **Mobile Experience**:
   - How to adapt the file upload experience for mobile devices
   - How to ensure the chat interface is usable on smaller screens
   - How to handle limited bandwidth and processing power

### Open Questions

1. How to effectively demonstrate the value of RAG vs. regular chatbots to users?
2. What metrics should we track to measure the effectiveness of the demo?
3. How to balance between showcasing technical capabilities and maintaining a simple UX?
4. What is the optimal chunk size for different document types to balance context and relevance?
5. How to handle rate limiting and usage quotas for the OpenAI API in a demo environment?
