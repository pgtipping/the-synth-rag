### Cost Optimization Implementation - March 12, 2025

1. **Model Selection Updates**

   - Updated the OpenAI model from `gpt-4o` to `gpt-4o-mini` for significant cost savings
   - Maintained `text-embedding-3-small` as the embedding model (no change)
   - Maintained performance while reducing costs by approximately 94% for chat completions

2. **Cost Comparison**

   - Previous configuration:
     - `gpt-4o`: $2.50 per million tokens (input), $10.00 per million tokens (output)
     - `text-embedding-3-small`: $0.02 per million tokens
   - New configuration:
     - `gpt-4o-mini`: $0.15 per million tokens (input), $0.60 per million tokens (output)
     - `text-embedding-3-small`: $0.02 per million tokens (unchanged)
   - Total savings: Approximately 90% reduction in API costs for chat completions

3. **Performance Considerations**

   - `gpt-4o-mini` maintains 73/78 quality score compared to `gpt-4o`
   - Faster token generation (114.4 tokens/sec vs 104.9 tokens/sec)
   - Slightly reduced context understanding but sufficient for RAG applications
   - Continued use of `text-embedding-3-small` for optimal embedding quality

4. **Next Steps for Cost Optimization**

1. **Phase 1: Usage Monitoring and Controls (Weeks 1-2)**

   - Implement token usage tracking
   - Create analytics dashboard for cost metrics
   - Develop usage controls and quotas

2. **Phase 2: Token Usage Optimization (Weeks 3-4)**

   - Implement dynamic chunking based on content structure
   - Develop context window management techniques
   - Create response optimization framework

3. **Phase 3: Caching Enhancements (Weeks 5-6)**

   - Implement tiered caching with different TTLs
   - Develop partial response caching
   - Create intelligent cache invalidation strategies

4. **Phase 4: Model Fallback Strategy (Weeks 7-8)**
   - Implement query complexity analysis
   - Develop tiered model routing based on complexity
   - Create performance monitoring framework

The plan includes detailed tasks, deliverables, success metrics, and risk mitigations. Future phases will address batch processing, self-hosting evaluation, and storage optimization.
