# Email Management Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a complete plan for implementing email management in our RAG application using SendGrid. The system will allow us to receive emails, store them in our database, view them in an admin dashboard, and reply to them directly from our application.

## 1. SendGrid Setup

### Domain Authentication

1. **Verify Domain Ownership**

   - Add CNAME records to our DNS settings
   - Verify our domain in the SendGrid dashboard
   - This proves we own the domain and can send/receive emails

2. **Email Authentication Setup**
   - Add SPF records to prevent email spoofing
   - Add DKIM records to digitally sign our emails
   - These improve deliverability and prevent our emails from being marked as spam

### Inbound Parse Configuration

1. **MX Records Setup**

   - Add MX records pointing to SendGrid's mail servers
   - This tells email servers to route mail for our domain to SendGrid

2. **Inbound Parse Rules**
   - Create a rule for our subdomain (e.g., rag.synthalyst.com)
   - Set a destination URL where SendGrid will send parsed emails
   - Enable spam checking to filter unwanted emails

### API Key Creation

1. **Create a Dedicated API Key**
   - Name it specifically for our email management system
   - Grant only the necessary permissions (Mail Send, Inbound Parse)
   - Store the API key securely in our environment variables

## 2. Database Structure

### Email Storage Schema

1. **Inbound Emails Table**

   - Store sender, recipient, subject, and content
   - Track status (unread, read, replied, archived)
   - Record timestamps for received emails
   - Include threading information for conversations

2. **Outbound Emails Table**
   - Store recipient, sender, subject, and content
   - Track status (draft, sent, failed)
   - Link replies to original inbound emails
   - Record timestamps for sent emails

## 3. Backend Implementation

### Email Receiving System

1. **Webhook Endpoint**

   - Create an API route to receive parsed emails from SendGrid
   - Extract email data from the incoming request
   - Store the email in our database
   - Handle attachments if necessary

2. **Email Processing Logic**
   - Validate incoming emails
   - Categorize emails based on recipient or content
   - Handle bounces and delivery failures
   - Implement spam filtering

### Email Sending System

1. **SendGrid Integration**

   - Set up a service to send emails via SendGrid's API
   - Create templates for common responses
   - Handle tracking and delivery status

2. **Reply Functionality**
   - Create an API endpoint for sending replies
   - Link replies to original emails for threading
   - Update the status of the original email when replied to

## 4. Frontend Implementation

### Email Dashboard

1. **Email List View**

   - Display all emails with sender, subject, and date
   - Show status indicators (unread, read, replied)
   - Implement sorting and filtering options
   - Add pagination for large numbers of emails

2. **Email Detail View**
   - Show the complete email content
   - Display conversation history if applicable
   - Provide options to reply, forward, or archive
   - Mark emails as read automatically when viewed

### Reply Interface

1. **Reply Form**

   - Create a user-friendly interface for composing replies
   - Include the original email for reference
   - Provide formatting options if needed
   - Add attachment support if required

2. **Status Indicators**
   - Show sending status when a reply is in progress
   - Confirm successful delivery
   - Handle and display errors if sending fails

## 5. Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Foundation

1. **SendGrid Configuration**

   - Complete all domain authentication steps
   - Set up inbound parse webhook
   - Create and secure API keys

2. **Database Setup**
   - Create email-related tables in our database
   - Set up proper indexes for efficient queries
   - Establish relationships between tables

### Phase 2: Core Functionality

1. **Receiving System**

   - Implement the webhook endpoint
   - Test with sample emails
   - Verify proper storage in the database

2. **Basic Admin View**
   - Create a simple dashboard to view received emails
   - Implement basic filtering and sorting
   - Add status management (mark as read)

### Phase 3: Complete System

1. **Reply Functionality**

   - Implement the email sending service
   - Create the reply interface
   - Test the complete email conversation flow

2. **Enhanced Features**
   - Add threading support
   - Implement advanced filtering
   - Add analytics for email volume and response times

## 6. Testing Plan

1. **Functional Testing**

   - Test receiving emails from various sources
   - Verify proper storage and retrieval
   - Test reply functionality and threading

2. **Edge Cases**

   - Test handling of malformed emails
   - Verify behavior with attachments
   - Test with high volume of emails

3. **User Experience Testing**
   - Verify dashboard usability
   - Test the reply interface
   - Ensure proper status updates and notifications

## 7. Maintenance Considerations

1. **Monitoring**

   - Track email volume and processing times
   - Monitor for failed deliveries or errors
   - Set up alerts for unusual activity

2. **Backup and Recovery**

   - Implement regular backups of email data
   - Create procedures for recovering from failures
   - Document the recovery process

3. **Scaling**
   - Plan for increased email volume
   - Consider database partitioning for large email archives
   - Optimize queries for performance

## Conclusion

This email management system will provide a complete solution for handling communications in our RAG application. By using SendGrid's services for both sending and receiving emails, we can create a seamless experience for managing all email communications directly within our application interface.
