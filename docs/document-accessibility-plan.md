# Document Accessibility Implementation Plan - 2025-03-14 19:26:06 EDT

## Understanding of Current Issues

Based on analysis of the codebase, the following issues with document accessibility have been identified:

1. **Database Connection Issues**: There appear to be problems with the connection to the database when retrieving document chunks.

2. **Unsafe SQL Queries**: The current implementation uses string interpolation for SQL queries in the chat route, which is vulnerable to SQL injection.

3. **Document Retrieval Problems**: The system is having trouble retrieving document content from Pinecone, likely due to missing document chunks.

4. **Document Processing Failures**: Some documents are failing to process correctly, and the error handling needs improvement.

5. **UI Improvements Needed**: The document selector UI has been enhanced but may need further improvements for better user experience.

## Current Implementation

The system currently has:

1. **Document Upload**: Users can upload documents which are stored in PostgreSQL.

2. **Document Processing**: Documents are processed to extract text, which is then chunked and indexed in Pinecone.

3. **Document Selection**: Users can select documents to use in chat sessions via a document selector component.

4. **Document Reprocessing**: There's a feature to reprocess documents that failed to process correctly.

5. **Document Status Tracking**: Documents have statuses (uploaded, processing, indexed, failed) that are tracked in the database.

2. **Audit All SQL Queries**:

   - Review all SQL queries in the codebase for security issues
   - Refactor any unsafe queries to use parameterized queries
   - Add validation for user inputs used in queries

3. **Implement Query Builder**:
   - Create a simple query builder utility to safely construct complex queries
   - Use the query builder for all dynamic queries
   - Add type safety to query parameters

### 3. Improve Document Retrieval - Priority: High

   - Add retry logic for failed Pinecone requests
   - Implement better logging for Pinecone operations

2. **Fix Vector ID Tracking**:

   - Ensure vector IDs are properly stored in the document_chunks table
   - Add validation to confirm vectors exist in Pinecone
   - Implement a reconciliation process to fix missing vectors

3. **Optimize Document Chunk Retrieval**:
   - Implement batched retrieval for better performance
   - Add caching for frequently accessed chunks
   - Improve error handling for chunk retrieval

### 4. Enhance Document Processing - Priority: Medium

3. **Add Document Processing Monitoring**:
   - Create a processing status dashboard
   - Implement alerts for processing failures
   - Add metrics for processing performance

### 5. Enhance Document Management UI - Priority: Medium

#### Issues to Address:

- User experience for document management
- Document selection and filtering

#### Implementation Steps:

1. **Improve Document Selector Component**:

   - Enhance the document selector UI with better filtering options
   - Add sorting options for documents
   - Implement search functionality for documents
   - Add pagination for large document lists

2. **Enhance Document Status Display**:

   - Improve status badges with more detailed information
   - Add tooltips for status explanations
   - Implement progress indicators for processing documents

3. **Add Document Management Features**:
   - Implement document tagging for better organization
   - Add document grouping by use case
   - Implement document archiving for better management

### 6. Implement Document Focus Feature - Priority: Medium

#### Issues to Address:

- Users need to be able to focus on specific documents in chat

#### Implementation Steps:

1. **Enhance Document Selection**:

   - Implement multi-select for documents
   - Add a "focus mode" for selected documents
   - Store selected documents in session state

2. **Update Chat Context Retrieval**:

   - Modify the chat route to prioritize selected documents
   - Implement a hybrid approach that combines selected documents with semantic search
   - Add weighting for selected documents in context retrieval

3. **Enhance UI for Document Focus**:
   - Add visual indicators for focused documents
   - Implement a toggle for switching between focused and general mode
   - Add a document focus panel in the chat interface

### 7. Add Document Analytics - Priority: Low

#### Issues to Address:

- Understanding document usage and performance

#### Implementation Steps:

1. **Implement Document Usage Tracking**:

   - Track which documents are used in chat sessions
   - Measure document relevance in responses
   - Track document selection frequency

2. **Add Document Performance Metrics**:

   - Measure document processing performance
   - Track document retrieval performance
