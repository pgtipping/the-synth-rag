# Email Management Implementation Summary

## Overview

We have successfully implemented a complete email management system for the SynthBots application using SendGrid. This system allows the application to:

1. Receive emails via SendGrid's Inbound Parse webhook
2. Store emails in a PostgreSQL database
3. View and manage emails through an admin interface
4. Reply to emails directly from the application

## Components Implemented

### 1. Database Schema

- Created Prisma schema with two main models:
  - `InboundEmail`: For storing received emails
  - `OutboundEmail`: For storing sent replies
- Added relationships between models for email threading

### 2. SendGrid Integration

- Set up domain authentication for `synthbots.synthalyst.com`
- Configured Inbound Parse webhook for receiving emails
- Implemented email sending via SendGrid's API

### 3. API Endpoints

- `/api/webhooks/email`: Webhook endpoint for receiving parsed emails from SendGrid
- `/api/admin/emails`: Endpoint for fetching all emails with pagination and filtering
- `/api/admin/emails/[id]`: Endpoint for fetching a single email and updating its status
- `/api/admin/emails/reply`: Endpoint for sending replies to received emails

### 4. Admin Interface

- `/admin/emails`: Page for viewing all received emails with status indicators
- `/admin/emails/[id]`: Page for viewing a single email and sending replies

## How It Works

### Receiving Emails

1. Emails sent to any address at `synthbots.synthalyst.com` are routed to SendGrid
2. SendGrid parses the email and sends it to our webhook endpoint
3. The webhook endpoint extracts the email data and stores it in the database
4. The email appears in the admin interface as "UNREAD"

### Viewing Emails

1. The admin interface fetches emails from the database
2. Emails are displayed with sender, subject, and status information
3. When an email is viewed, its status is updated to "READ"

### Replying to Emails

1. Admin composes a reply in the email detail view
2. The reply is sent via SendGrid's API
3. The reply is stored in the database and linked to the original email
4. The original email's status is updated to "REPLIED"

## Configuration

### DNS Records Required

1. **MX Records** for receiving emails:

   - Host: `synthbots` (for `synthbots.synthalyst.com`)
   - Value: `mx.sendgrid.net`
   - Priority: 10

2. **CNAME Records** for domain authentication:
   - These are provided by SendGrid during the domain authentication process
   - Typically include records for DKIM authentication

### Environment Variables

```
# SendGrid Configuration
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key

# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/database_name
```

## Next Steps

1. **Email Templates**: Create reusable templates for common responses
2. **Email Filtering**: Add filtering and search capabilities to the admin interface
3. **Attachments**: Add support for handling email attachments
4. **User Management**: Add user authentication for the admin interface
5. **Email Analytics**: Track open rates, click rates, and other metrics

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a complete solution for managing email communications in the SynthBots application. It allows for receiving, viewing, and replying to emails directly within the application, with all communications stored in the database for future reference.
