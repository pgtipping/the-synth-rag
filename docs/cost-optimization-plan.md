# Cost Optimization Implementation Plan

_Created: March 12, 2025_

## Overview

This document outlines our phased approach to implementing cost optimization strategies for the RAG system. The plan focuses on maximizing cost efficiency while maintaining high performance and user experience quality.

## Current Optimizations

We have already implemented the following cost optimizations:

1. **Model Selection**

2. **Caching System**

   - Redis-based caching layer for embeddings and responses
   - Embedding cache with 7-day TTL

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk                      | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation                                     |

| Performance degradation   | High   | Medium     | Implement gradual rollout with A/B testing     |
| Cache coherence issues    | Medium | Medium     | Develop comprehensive test suite for caching   |
| User experience impact    | High   | Low        | Collect user feedback and monitor satisfaction |
| Implementation complexity | Medium | High       | Break down into smaller, manageable tasks      |
| Integration challenges    | Medium | Medium     | Create detailed integration tests              |

## Conclusion

This phased approach allows us to systematically implement cost optimization strategies while monitoring their impact on performance and user experience. By focusing on usage monitoring first, we establish a baseline that helps us measure the effectiveness of subsequent optimizations.

The plan prioritizes strategies that offer the highest ROI with the lowest implementation complexity, gradually moving toward more complex optimizations as we gather more data and experience.
